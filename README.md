Objectives: 

Analysis 1, The SalePrice of the house is related to the square footage of the living area of the house (GrLIvArea) and if the SalesPrice (and its relationship to square footage) depends on which neighborhood the house is located in.

Variables of interest: Neighborhood (NAmes,Edwards,BrkSide), SalesPrice, GrLIvArea.

Outcome of interest: SalePrice

Predictors: Neighborhood, GrLivArea, GrLivArea * Neighborhood

Deliverables: Restatement of the problem, build and fit model, assumption check (residuals plots, influential point analysis (cook's D and Leverage)), comparing competing models (Adj R^2 and internal CV press), Parameters (estimates, interpretation, confidence intervals) ,conclusions, and a codebook (well commented). 

Summary of Analysis 1.

Century 21 Ames in Ames Iowa has commissioned us to answer a few questions about their business.  They would like to know how the sale price of a house is related to the square footage of the living area of the house and if the sale price is dependent on the neighborhood the house is located in.  

Century 21 Ames has a statistical background and would like to make sure that model assumptions are addressed and that any suspicious observations are identified and addressed.  We'll wrap up by providing a written conclusion that quantifies the relationship between living area an dsale price with respect to the neighborhoods century 21 sells houses in.

Analysis 2, build the most predictive model for sales prices of homes in all of Ames Iowa, including all neighborhoods.  Four models are required, forward selection, backwards eliminations, one from stepwise selection, and a custom model.  

Deliverables: Restatement of the problem, model selection (stepwise,forward,backward,and custom), checking assumptions (residual plots, influential point analysis (Cook's D and Leverage)), comparing competing models (Adj R^2, Internal CV Press, Kaggle Score), conclusions, and a codebook (well commented)
